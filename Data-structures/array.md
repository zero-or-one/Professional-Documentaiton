# Array
## Definition

An Array is a collection of elements, each identified by an index. Arrays store elements of the same type in a contiguous memory location.
## Time Complexity

* Access: O(1)
* Search: O(n)
* Insertion: O(n) (In the worst case, you shift elements)
* Deletion: O(n)

## Example 

```python
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  # Array initialization
print(arr[2])  # Access element at index 2 -> Output: 3
```
